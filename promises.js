    // Promises in JavaScript are a powerful tool for managing asynchronous operations. 
    // They provide a way to handle asynchronous events more gracefully and avoid "callback hell,".

// What Are Promises?
    // A Promise in JavaScript represents an operation that hasnâ€™t completed yet but is expected in the future. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous fashion. A promise can be in one of three states:

    // Pending: The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
    // Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully.
    // Rejected: The operation failed

// Why Use Promises?
//     1. Avoiding Callback Hell:
//     Promises help you avoid deeply nested callbacks, commonly known as "callback hell" or the "Pyramid of Doom."
    //    2. API Standardization:
    //    Promises have become a standard pattern for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript, and many modern JavaScript APIs return promises.
